# ðŸ¦› Hungry Hippos Robot Game  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
As part of our Master's degree in Computer Science, our team of five is developing a **Hungry Hippos-style game** using **Lego Meccano robots**. The goal is to design and program two autonomous robots that compete to **collect as many balls as possible** in a limited time.  

## ðŸ¤– Technical Details  
- **Robots:** 2 autonomous Lego EV3 robots  
- **Programming Languages:** Python & C++  
- **Computing Unit:** Raspberry Pi controlling the robots  
- **Vision System:**  
  - **Two overhead cameras** track the game arena  
  - The **video stream** is transmitted over a **private Wi-Fi network**  
  - The **Raspberry Pi processes the images** and sends movement commands to the robots  
- **Game Setup:**  
  - Balls are randomly **dropped into the arena**  
  - The robots must **identify and collect** them as fast as possible
